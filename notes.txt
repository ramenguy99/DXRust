TODO:
- Reference rasterizer with same resources
    - setup matrices in constant buffer
    - proper pixel shader
    - debug / check everything

- Support more complex scenes 
    - better api for building tlas/blas
    - secondary rays / recursion
    - PBR

- Imgui keyboard
- Smooth resizing
    - Resizing is not smooth because DispatchMessage blocks while resizing
    - To support smooth resizing we would need to draw from the wndproc
    - This requires some restructuring, basically the main loop would have to
      execute inside a closure that we can call from the wndproc


- D3D12 refactoring (ideally complete safe API for all d3d12 features):
    - error callback with panic instead of breakpoint
    - scoped barriers (closures or immutable transparent type with drop)
    - command list / render pass abstraction (render pass on top of list?)
    - Graphics pipeline state helpers
    - Results everywhere (ours and map windows-rs results or just windows-rs?)
